command N easy create только нажать и задержать
javac (main.main.java) = compile and create main.main.class

?Run our app
if we want to run our app we must have Main directory , then create with this command javac Main.java => Main.class and then
we can run our app from for example src directory with this command => java main.Main

?Comments
single => like in JS

multiple =>
/*
[Something]
[Something]
[Something]
*/

//In Java same as  in JS => (ternary) (if else) (switch case) (math) (brake continue)


TIPS
1)We can create for statement with less code example = numbers.for[and find in IDE which we wont to create]
2)Watch for arrays => Arrays.stream(arrays).forEach(System.out::println);

?Reminder!!!!!!!!!!!!
    int [] numbersArr = new int[2] => we must to declare how many items will be in array same as boolean string etc...
or
    int [] numbers = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};


    final = const (JS)
